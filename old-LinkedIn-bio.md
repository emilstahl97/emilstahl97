As an M.Sc.Eng. student in Software Engineering of Distributed Systems at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, I have specialized in the areas of networking and automation. I am dedicated to leveraging technology as a deflationary tool, empowering people and organizations to drive innovation and progress.

I firmly believe that technological development and innovation are the primary forces behind deflation in society. Technology's ability to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and increase productivity has a profound impact on economic growth. In fact, technology acts as a catalyst for deflation, enabling central banks worldwide to adopt accommodative monetary policies that further stimulate growth. This, in turn, pulls people out of poverty and elevates the overall well-being of society.

As engineers, we bear a significant responsibility to create products and services that not only harness the power of technology but also contribute positively to humanity. By doing so, we can amplify the deflationary effects of technology, making them accessible to a broader population. This commitment to innovation and social impact holds the potential to benefit all of humanity.

My passion lies in developing cutting-edge technology that propels humanity towards a brighter future and promotes global economic growth for the benefit of all. With a firm belief in the power of technology to transform the world, I am committed to creating solutions that make a positive impact on society.

Throughout my studies and career, I have acquired extensive experience in various programming languages and tools. My repertoire spans across Python, Scala, Java, C, Javascript, Swift, SQL, Docker, Flask, React, Firebase, as well as Spark and Kafka, among other cutting-edge technologies.

I've had the privilege of harnessing these competencies to contribute to an extensive spectrum of projects, spanning from the past to the present. My hallmark lies in consistently delivering solutions of the utmost caliber.
